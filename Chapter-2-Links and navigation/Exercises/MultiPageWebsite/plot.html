            <h1>Plot Summary</h1>
            <p>Peter Parker, a shy high school student, gains spider-like abilities after being bitten by a genetically
                modified spider. As he grapples with his powers, the death of his Uncle Ben teaches him that "with great
                power comes great responsibility." He becomes Spider-Man and must stop the villainous Green Goblin while
                protecting the ones he loves.</p>
            <p>The story also explores Peter's internal struggle between his responsibilities as a hero and his desires as a
                teenager. His relationships with Mary Jane and Harry Osborn are tested, especially as Norman Osborn's descent into
                madness threatens everyone Peter loves. The emotional weight of Uncle Ben’s death becomes Peter’s driving force,
                shaping his identity as Spider-Man.</p>
